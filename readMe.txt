In this example , we are trying to build a simplest browser :
so we will start by establishing a connection to a remote server , and then we gona request for a document using method GET ( via the protocol HTTP ) .

and after that we will save the received response in a data variable so we can use it later .

Simple as that :) 


Now we will create a simple server to fetch the request and response back to that request .
